# California Wildfires Data Analysis
By: Emily Wimmer, Georgina Young, Ivelisse Montero, Dominique Kelsey, Gavin Bozan

This project analyzes California wildfires from 2013-2019. We formatted our website to easily interact with the map to pull the specific data the viewers are looking for. Starting with a fun homepage, access the dashboard via the navigation bar. The dashboard features a chloropleth map that features a toggle legend button to keep the pesky legend out of the way, an interactive table to easily analyze the data, and a interactive bar chart to seperate by year and acres burned! The map navigation features a heat map designed to view markers of the names of fires and years they started. Finally, our about us and work cited page showcases the behind the scenes of the brilliant minds behind the design!
