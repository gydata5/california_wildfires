In this project, we analyzed California wildfire data to find patterns and trends. Using Python, we cleaned and organized the data, fixing dates, categorizing information, and formatting numbers to make analysis easier.

Our findings showed where and when wildfires happen most often, as well as how their frequency has changed over time. We used charts and maps to make these trends clear.

This project showed how data analysis can help us understand wildfire risks. Future improvements could include adding weather and land use data to better predict wildfires.
